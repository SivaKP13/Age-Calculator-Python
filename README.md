These are my first coding projects in which I have explored the use of variables, inputs, and if statements. First, I have used Python as my coding language as I heard it was easy. After a few lessons, I decided to try my skills and I found it pretty easy. Throughout coding this, I felt like I was grasping the use of variables and inputs better with every line of code.

To challenge myself, I replicated my code and changed it to work in Java, which I found much harder since it included brackets and classes. I must admit that I had to use AI for a good portion of this code, but the concept and idea of this code was entirely from me. With a few more Java projects, I hope to understand why and how to use classes and brackets in Java.
