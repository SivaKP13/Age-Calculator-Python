These are my first coding projects in which I have explored the use of variables, inputs, and if statements. First, I have used Python as my coding language as I heard it was easy. After a few lessons, I decided to try my skills and I found it pretty easy. 

To challenge myself, I replicated my code and changed it to work in Java, which I found much harder since it included brackets and classes.
